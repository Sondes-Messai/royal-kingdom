              Colchis,ancient region at the estearn end the black sea south of the caucasus,in the western part of the modern georgia.
              It consisted of the valley of the Phasis (modern Rioni) River.
              Colchis was the home of Medea and the destination of the Argonauts.
              a land of fabulous wealth and the domain of sorcery,
              Historically, Colchis was colonized by Milesian Greeks, to whom the native Colchians supplied gold,
              slaves, hides, linen cloth, agricultural produce, and such shipbuilding materials as timber, flax, pitch, and wax.
              The ethnic composition of the Colchians, who were described by Herodotus as black Egyptians, 
              is unclear. After the 6th century BCE they lived under the nominal suzerainty of Achaemenian Persia,
              passed into the kingdom of Mithradates VI (1st century BCE), and then came under the rule of Rome.
